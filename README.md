# chesspi_client
This is a client that sends PGN data to chesspi.

## References:
1. [chesspi](https://github.com/prateeksan/chesspi): Started with forking that repo to create my own chess database (games I've played on chess.com). This repo to help me push games from chess.com into this database so I can analyze my opening success/failure.
2. [eco chess database](https://github.com/NCarson/pg-eco): by way of [SCID](http://scid.sourceforge.net/); I took this file and modified it into a CSV so I can capture the ECO for the games I've played on chess.com because they do not put ECO on my live chess games. ECO is required for chesspi.
